### Current System


### Proposed System

The main aim of my system is to simplify the process of creating and hosting a competition in Catching Features and to combine the many separate processes previously required.

The main features of the system will be:
* Allow the creation of multi-race competitions with limited difficulty (Drag and Drop UI?)
* Allow a host to upload custom map files for players to then download for use within multiplayer
* Allow players to view the results from all races
* Allow the host to choose a scoring system for races or create their own custom score
  * Percentages behind winner
  * 1st - 100, 2nd - 99
  * Etc
* Be able to notify players with their results or progress. Either by an automatic email and/or through inbuilt notifications
* Allow the user to create an account so hosts can easily add them to a race
* All user information will be stored securely
