# NEA Project

### Current System
At the moment the only way to create and manage a multi stage catching features competition is through using a spreadsheet such as excel or google sheets. This method requires a lot of manual input or complicated formulae.

If you want to use a custom map you then have to use another file sharing webservice such as dropbox or google drive. Which then adds another layer of complexity to the competition.

There is also no automatic way of notifying a competitor if they have gotten through to the next round or not except via email or IM service, which again, adds another layer of complexity.


### Proposed System

The main aim of my system is to simplify the process of creating and hosting a competition in Catching Features and to combine the many separate processes previously required.

The main features of the system will be:
* [ ] Allow the creation of multi-race competitions with limited difficulty (Drag and Drop UI?)
* [ ] Allow a host to upload custom map files for players to then download for use within multiplayer
* [ ] Allow players to view the results from all races
* [ ] Allow the host to choose a scoring system for races or create their own custom score:
  * Percentages behind winner
  * 1st - 100, 2nd - 99
  * Etc
* [ ] Be able to notify players with their results or progress. Either by an automatic email and/or through inbuilt notifications
* [ ] Allow the user to create an account so hosts can easily add them to a race
* [ ] All user information will be stored securely
